# CI/CD Pipeline for Kubernetes Deployment

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a **CI/CD pipeline** to automate the deployment of containerized applications on **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**. The pipeline integrates several industry-standard tools to ensure a seamless, scalable, and reliable deployment process.

---

## Features

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automates code integration, testing, and quality assurance.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automates deployment of containerized applications to **Kubernetes clusters**.
- **Code Quality Assurance:** Uses **SonarQube** for static code analysis to detect bugs and vulnerabilities during the integration phase.
- **Containerization:** Utilizes **Docker** to create consistent and portable application images.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Deploys infrastructure components using **Kubernetes manifests** and **Helm charts**.
- **Monitoring and Scaling:** Ensures application reliability and scalability through **Kubernetes** native features.

---

## Tools and Technologies

- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **CI/CD Automation:** Jenkins, ArgoCD
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
- **Static Code Analysis:** SonarQube
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Artifact Repository:** Docker Hub

---

## Architecture

1. **Source Code Management:** 
   - Developers push code to a **GitHub repository**.

2. **CI Pipeline:**
   - Jenkins fetches the latest code from GitHub.
   - Code is analyzed for quality using **SonarQube**.
   - Application is built using **Maven** and Docker images are created.
   - Docker images are pushed to **Docker Hub**.

3. **CD Pipeline:**
   - **ArgoCD** pulls updated Kubernetes manifests and Docker images.
   - Deployments are orchestrated on **AWS EKS**.

4. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Deployed applications are monitored for performance and reliability.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with EKS configured.
- Jenkins server set up with necessary plugins (Git, Docker, Maven, SonarQube).
- ArgoCD installed on the Kubernetes cluster.
- Docker Hub account for storing container images.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ci-cd-pipeline
   ```

2. **Configure Jenkins:**
   - Install required plugins (Git, Docker, SonarQube, Kubernetes CLI).
   - Create a Jenkins pipeline and link it to the repository.

3. **Set up Docker:**
   - Build the application:
     ```bash
     docker build -t <dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:<tag> .
     ```
   - Push the image to Docker Hub:
     ```bash
     docker push <dockerhub-username>/<image-name>:<tag>
     ```

4. **Deploy with ArgoCD:**
   - Apply Kubernetes manifests:
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f manifests/
     ```
   - Sync with ArgoCD:
     ```bash
     argocd app sync <app-name>
     ```

---

## Results

- Deployment times reduced by **40%**.
- Improved **code quality** with static analysis tools.
- Seamless deployment and scalability using **Kubernetes** on **AWS EKS**.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring and visualization.
- Integrate **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning.
- Implement **Blue/Green** and **Canary Deployments** for zero-downtime releases.
